                        About Me
                    </b>
                    <p>
                        Greetings! I'm Peter, a tech enthusiast with a lifelong passion for all things digital. 
                        My journey into the world of Information Technology started at a young age, fueled by my curiosity for computers. 
                        I would eagerly disassemble and reassemble old computers from my dad's office, laying the foundation for my hands-on approach to technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I grew up and built on my technical skills I began modding games I enjoyed playing which allowed me to get exposure to a variety of languages. 
                        The ability to create and experience my additions firsthand in projects I loved further grew my interest in programming. 
                        Upon reaching high school, I took the next step by developing a python text-based RPG game 'Dragon Slayer' along with a 2D Pokemon game with some Java.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond the screen, I'm equally passionate about the great outdoors, embarking on annual adventures such as portaging the Bowron Lakes or torturing my cardiovascular system with weeklong backpacking trips. 
                        I also developed a keen interest in aviation, I quickly found myself flying airplanes before even learning to drive and I now have my own private pilot's license!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've just graduated from BCIT's Computer Information Technology program and I'm excited to begin working in the industry.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Developed several python applications for projects using a large variety of packages.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Designed several websites in a UI/UX Course and then deployed them using a javascript backend.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Coursework includes developing applications and websites, designing and implementing databases and then automating their deployment on cloud services
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Learned how software, hardware, and networks work and interact with each other and configured firewalls, bridges, and routers on virtual networks for security projects.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Covered a variety of best security practices and gained firsthand security experience in simulated and practical scenarios. Reviewed case studies on previous security incidents.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developed and deployed CI/CD pipelines on Gitlab (Python, Bash) and Jenkins (Groovy)

                    </ul>
                   
                    <p>
                        Studying at BCIT was a great experience, all the professors were very kind and knowledgable. 
                        I was able to work on a wide variety of projects with my classmates using a variety of formats and technologies. 
                        I even gained some real world experience working in an agile/scrum team environment for the BC Center for Aquatic Health Science. 
                        Together, we designed and built a more efficent MySQL database and developed some backend endpoints to query and visualize data using Python and R Script.
                        I'm confident I made the right choice going to BCIT and I'm really looking forward to building upon the knowledge gained from the CIT program in the industry.

                    <b>Pilot License</b>
                    <p>
                        I started my training in Squamish after taking a tour flight through Glacier Air. It was too easy to fall in love with the view when you're flying over the beautiful glaciers we have here in BC.
                        After doing ground school for a few months and finishing up high school, I began doing training at Pacific Flying School located in Boundary Bay, Delta. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At PFC, I obtained my Private Pilot's license along with several ratings for flying at night, to the US, or in mountainous terrain following visual flight rules.
                        I was able to meet some industry professionals and even got a chance to fly a Boeing 737 simulator owned by Air Canada through a special opportunity.

                    <b>My Experience</b>
                    <p>
                        Coast Mountain Academy was the perfect mix between academics and adventure.
                        I could spend thursday afternoon programming my own games in our python class (I'd usually finish all the assignments pretty quickly) and come Friday we'd be hiking up the side of the Squamish Chief to overlook the entire valley.
                        At this school everyone got along and we were all encouraged to pursue our interests. 
                    <p>

                    </p>
                        Even though the school was new and the classes were small the teachers there offered many different subjects in science, tech, media, music, and literature.
                        Going this extra mile really made the difference for me, and I think that this really helped push me to get interested in software development. 
                        Ironically, my teacher offered me a seat on a tour flight when another student ended up sick with Glacier Air and I had my student pilots license a few months later...

                        Automated deployment for a simple front-end web application which fetched database information through a seperate backend instance. 
                        All public requests are routed through nginx on the frontend and all internal queries for the database are processed through the backend.

                        The servers run with Python on EC2 Instances and the database is hosted on an RDS instance all automated with Terraform and Ansible. 
                        We store the terraform state in an S3 Bucket to ensure it stays consistent with the actual state of terraform.
                        I also wrote a simple bash script to run all of the commands in order and remove any previous working instances ran locally.

                        Acmestock Co was a scaled microservice based application which was hosted on Azure cloud VMs had several endpoints that could be requested (some with parameters) to query data from the application's database. 
                        My model was a stock trading company, and had endpoints to create new sell orders and company listings. I set up and configured kafka/zookeeper message broker service to ensure consistency among internal requests.

                    <p>
                        The entire system was containerized through docker and some of the services such as the receiver and storage service were scaled up to account for large amounts of traffic during testing.
                        I also implemented a health check endpoint which would return 200 for purposes of automation (Restarts the docker container if the application doesnt send a 200 response).
